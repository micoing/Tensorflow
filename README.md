# Tensorflow
First, i followd the tensorflow example code. 
By using the code in Learning Tensorflow book #https://github.com/Hezi-Resheff/Oreilly-Learning-Tensorflow, i learned the tensorflow with python.
Second, i studied about coverting the Tiff images file. So, mainly i will load the CNN(convolutional neural network) code.
